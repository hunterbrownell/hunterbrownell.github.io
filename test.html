        <h2>Visualization Rationale</h2>
        <p>
            

For our visualization, we decided to use line charts with critical points. The choice to use line charts is effective in showing trends over time. Lines provide a clear visualization of the direction and rate of change, while points highlight specific data points, making it easier for users to discern exact values at given times. Assigning different colors to lines and points based on the country allows viewers to distinguish between multiple countries' data simultaneously. Including axes and labels improves readability and context. The use of a linear scale for both the X (decade) and Y (population) axes complements the quantitative nature of the data. 
Implementing a box to filter the visualization by country or continent offers a straightforward way for users to customize the data they are viewing. This interactivity enhances the user experience by allowing dynamic exploration of the dataset. Displaying a tooltip with detailed information (country name, decade, and population) when hovering over points provides immediate access to precise data values without cluttering the main visualization.
An alternative to line charts could have been the use of bar charts to represent population data. However, bar charts are generally more suited to discrete data points and comparisons rather than showing trends over time. For this dataset, line charts are a better fit. Instead of filtering, interactive sliders could have been used to select ranges of decades or population values. We thought it would take away from our primary goal of comparing trends across countries.
The design choices we used seem to prioritize the ability to discern trends between different values. The selected visual encodings and interaction aim to allow users to navigate and explore the dataset effectively without overwhelming complexity.


Our development process went well with an effective split of work between group members. We took turns for the most part with the project, each adding different things as time went on. Between the two of us, we estimate roughly 25 man hours were put into this project. That includes EDA and refreshers on how certain functionalities within javascript are implemented. It took the most time to get the filtering function to work correctly. For some reason there were lots of problems with the search function highlighting parts of the graph in its entirety.
